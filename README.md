# What is this project?

A Python REST API on top of the FreeRADIUS database for automation purposes.

* It provides an [object-oriented view](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius/blob/main/docs/conceptual-approach.md#class-diagram) of the database schema
* It implements [some logic](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius/blob/main/docs/conceptual-approach.md#domain-logic) to ensure data consistency

It relies on [pyfreeradius](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius) package which was originally embedded in this project.

> I recommend to read the docs of `pyfreeradius` since this project is now essentially a wrapper.

## What database support?

It works with MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite using DB-API 2.0 ([PEP 249](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/)) compliant drivers such as:

```
mysql-connector-python
psycopg
psycopg2
pymysql
pysqlite3
sqlite3
```

It may work with other compliant drivers, yet not tested.

## Post a NAS, a user or a group

```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/nas' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "nasname": "5.5.5.5",
  "shortname": "my-nas",
  "secret": "my-secret"
}'
#> 201 Created
```
```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/users' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "username": "my-user@my-realm",
  "checks": [{"attribute": "Cleartext-Password", "op": ":=", "value": "my-pass"}],
  "replies": [
    {"attribute": "Framed-IP-Address", "op": ":=", "value": "192.168.0.1"},
    {"attribute": "Huawei-Vpn-Instance","op": ":=", "value": "my-vrf"}
  ]
}'
#> 201 Created
```
```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/groups' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "groupname": "300m",
  "replies": [
    {"attribute": "Filter-Id", "op": ":=", "value": "300m"}
  ]
}'
#> 201 Created
```

## Patch a NAS, a user or a group

The update strategy follows [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396) (JSON Merge Patch) guidelines:

* omitted fields during the update are not modified
* `None` value means removal (i.e., resets a field to its default value)
* **a list field can only be overwritten (replaced)**

As a consequence of the last point, to add attributes to an existing user (or a group), you must fetch the existing attributes first, combine them with the new ones, and send the result as the update parameter.

```sh
curl -X 'PATCH' \
  'http://localhost:8000/nas/5.5.5.5' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "secret": "new-secret",
  "shortname": "new-shortname"
}'
#> 200 OK
```
```sh
curl -X 'PATCH' \
  'http://localhost:8000/users/my-user%40my-realm' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "checks": [{"attribute": "Cleartext-Password", "op": ":=", "value": "new-pass"}],
  "replies": [
    {"attribute": "Framed-IP-Address", "op": ":=", "value": "192.168.0.1"},
    {"attribute": "Framed-Route", "op": "+=", "value": "192.168.1.0/24"},
    {"attribute": "Huawei-Vpn-Instance","op": ":=", "value": "my-vrf"}
  ]
}'
#> 200 OK
```
```sh
curl -X 'PATCH' \
  'http://localhost:8000/groups/300m' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "replies": [
    {"attribute": "Filter-Id", "op": ":=", "value": "300m-premium"}
  ]
}'
#> 200 OK
```

## Delete a NAS, a user or a group

```sh
curl -X 'DELETE' http://localhost:8000/nas/5.5.5.5
#> 204 No Content
```
```sh
curl -X 'DELETE' http://localhost:8000/users/my-user@my-realm
#> 204 No Content
```
```sh
curl -X 'DELETE' http://localhost:8000/groups/300m
#> 204 No Content
```

Reminder:

* When a user is deleted, so are its attributes and its belonging to groups ([read more](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius#delete-a-user))
* When a group is deleted, so are its attributes and its belonging to users ([read more](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius#delete-a-group))

# HOWTO

**An instance of the FreeRADIUS server is NOT needed for testing.** The focus is on the FreeRADIUS database. As long as you have one, the API can run on a Python environment.

## Using Docker

I made a full Docker stack for testing purposes that should run "as is". It includes the API and a MySQL database with some initial data ðŸ˜Š

If you already have a FreeRADIUS database (either local or remote) or if you fear Docker, you can skip this section ðŸš€

```bash
wget https://github.com/angely-dev/freeradius-api/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd freeradius-api-master/docker
#
docker compose up -d
```

Docker output should be like this:

```bash
Creating network "docker_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "docker_myvol" with default driver
Pulling mydb (mysql:)...
[â€¦]
Building radapi
[â€¦]
Pulling myadmin (phpmyadmin:)...
[â€¦]
Creating docker_mydb_1 ... done
Creating docker_myadmin_1 ... done
Creating docker_radapi_1  ... done
```

Then go to: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Using a venv

* Get the project and set the venv:

```bash
wget https://github.com/angely-dev/freeradius-api/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd freeradius-api-master
#
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Edit [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/angely-dev/freeradius-api/blob/master/requirements.txt) to set the DB driver depending on your database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.):

```py
# Uncomment the appropriate line matching the DB-API 2.0 (PEP 249) compliant driver to use
mysql-connector-python
#psycopg
#psycopg2
#pymysql
#pysqlite3
#sqlite3
```

* Then install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Edit [`src/settings.py`](https://github.com/angely-dev/freeradius-api/blob/master/freeradius-api/settings.py) to set your DB settings (driver, connection and table names):

```py
# Uncomment the appropriate line matching the DB-API 2.0 (PEP 249) compliant driver to use
DB_DRIVER = "mysql.connector"
#DB_DRIVER = "psycopg"
#DB_DRIVER = "psycopg2"
#DB_DRIVER = "pymysql"
#DB_DRIVER = "pysqlite3"
#DB_DRIVER = "sqlite3"

# Database connection settings
DB_NAME = "raddb"
DB_USER = "raduser"
DB_PASS = "radpass"
DB_HOST = "mydb"

# Database table names
RAD_TABLES = RadTables(
    radcheck="radcheck",
    radreply="radreply",
    radgroupcheck="radgroupcheck",
    radgroupreply="radgroupreply",
    radusergroup="radusergroup",
    nas="nas",
)
```

* You can also customize the number of results per page:

```py
# Number of results per page for pagination
ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 100
```

* Finally, you may want to configure the API URL (especially in production):

```py
# API_URL will be used to set the "Location" header field
# after a resource has been created (POST) as per RFC 7231
# and the "Link" header field (pagination) as per RFC 8288
API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```

* That's it! Now run the API and play with it live! All thanks to [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) generating the OpenAPI specs which is rendered by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) ðŸ˜Š

```bash
$ cd src
$ uvicorn api:app
INFO:     Started server process [12884]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

* Then go to: http://localhost:8000/docs

# Keyset pagination

As of [v1.3.0](https://github.com/angely-dev/freeradius-api/tree/v1.3.0), results are paginated (fetching all results at once is generally not needed nor recommended). There are two common options for pagination:

* Offset pagination (aka `LIMIT` + `OFFSET`) â€” not implemented
* **Keyset pagination (aka `WHERE` + `LIMIT`) â€” implemented**

In the era of infinite scroll, the latter is generally preferred over the former. Not only is it better at performance but also simpler to implement. [Read more about the implementation details.](https://github.com/angely-dev/pyfreeradius/blob/main/docs/keyset-pagination.md)

## Usage

Pagination is done through HTTP response headers (as per [RFC 8288](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288)) rather than JSON metadata. This is [debatable](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12123511) but I prefer the returned JSON to contain only business data. Actually, this is what [GitHub API does](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers).

Here is an example for fetching usernames (the same applies for groupnames and nasnames):

```bash
$ curl -X 'GET' -i http://localhost:8000/users
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Mon, 05 Jun 2023 20:07:09 GMT
server: uvicorn
content-length: 121
content-type: application/json
link: <http://localhost:8000/users?from_username=acb>; rel="next" # notice the Link header

["aaa","aab","aac","aad","aae","aaf","aag","aah","aai","aba","abb","abc","abd","abe","abf","abg","abh","abi","aca","acb"]
```

The API consumer (e.g., a frontend app) can then scroll to the next page `/users?from_username=acb`:

```bash
$ curl -X 'GET' -i http://localhost:8000/users?from_username=acb
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Mon, 05 Jun 2023 20:07:43 GMT
server: uvicorn
content-length: 121
content-type: application/json
link: <http://localhost:8000/users?from_username=aed>; rel="next" # notice the Link header

["acc","acd","ace","acf","acg","ach","aci","ada","adb","adc","add","ade","adf","adg","adh","adi","aea","aeb","aec","aed"]
```

And so on until there are no more results to fetch:

```bash
$ curl -X 'GET' -i http://localhost:8000/users?from_username=zzz
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Mon, 05 Jun 2023 20:08:06 GMT
server: uvicorn
content-length: 2
content-type: application/json
# no more Link header
```

> Only `rel="next"` is implemented since there wasn't a need yet for `rel="prev|last|first"`.

# API authentication

You may want to add authentication to the API.

## TL;DR

A simple solution is through API key.
Only two steps are required this way:

* Create `src/auth.py`:

```py
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security.api_key import APIKeyHeader

_x_api_key = 'my-valid-key'
_x_api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name='X-API-Key')

async def verify_key(x_api_key: str = Depends(_x_api_key_header)):
    if x_api_key != _x_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(401, 'Invalid key')
```

* Apply following changes in `src/api.py`:

```diff
# top of the file
+from auth import verify_key
+from fastapi import Depends

# bottom of the file
-app = FastAPI(title='FreeRADIUS REST API')
+app = FastAPI(title='FreeRADIUS REST API', dependencies=[Depends(verify_key)])
```

That's it! All endpoints now require authentication.

> In the above code, we make use of both [global dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/global-dependencies/) and [security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/first-steps/) features of FastAPI. API key is not properly documented yet but the issue https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/142 provides some working snippets.

> The key would not normally go "in the clear" in the code like this. Depending on your setup, it would be passed using CI/CD variables for example.

## Demo

### Using `curl`

```sh
$ curl -X 'GET' -i http://localhost:8000/users
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

{"detail":"Not authenticated"}
```
```sh
$ curl -X 'GET' -H 'X-API-Key: an-invalid-key' -i http://localhost:8000/users
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

{"detail":"Invalid key"}
```
```sh
$ curl -X 'GET' -H 'X-API-Key: my-valid-key' -i http://localhost:8000/users
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

["bob","alice@adsl","eve","oscar@wil.de"]
```

### Using the Web UI

Because the API key security scheme is part of the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-scheme-object), the need for authentication gets specified on the Web UI ðŸ˜Š

* You will now notice an `Authorize` button at the top-right corner as well as a little lock on each endpoint:

![swagger-auth-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4362224/214641998-2f323fb2-b90a-45a6-a09b-e4eadf1d1a29.png)

* To play with the API, you first need to provide the key by clicking that `Authorize` button:

![swagger-auth-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4362224/214642029-985ea676-bfe2-468f-bad8-c105b5cc5d69.png)

* Alternatively, on the Redoc Web UI:

![redoc-auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4362224/214642067-6c461a34-2679-43e2-88a7-b6316c459ae9.png)

## Explanation

FastAPI supports multiple security schemes, including OAuth2, API key and others. OAuth2 is a vast subject and will not be treated here. API key is a simple mechanism you probably already used in some projects. The [Swagger doc](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/) explains it very well:

> **An API key is a token that a client provides when making API calls.** The key can be sent in the query string or as a request header or as a cookie. API keys are supposed to be a secret that only the client and server know. Like Basic authentication, **API key-based authentication is only considered secure if used together with other security mechanisms such as HTTPS/SSL.**

A request header is quite common. Some examples:

* `X-API-Key: <TOKEN>` (as per the Swagger doc and the one I used in the solution)
* `X-Auth-Token: <TOKEN>` (e.g., LibreNMS)
* `Authorization: Token <TOKEN>` (e.g., NetBox and [DjangoREST-based projects](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/3.14.0/rest_framework/authentication.py#L151-L161) more generally)
* `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` (in accordance with [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-2.1) of the OAuth2 framework)

> The `X-` prefix denotes a non-standard HTTP header. You can set whatever name you prefer after that `X-`. The associated semantic is up to you. Some interesting background about the `X-` convention can be found in [RFC 6648](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6648#appendix-A) which, by the way, officially deprecates it.

> Although `Authorization: Token` seems more standard as it follows [RFC 2617](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2617) syntax, note the `Token` authentication scheme is not part of the [IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml) so it is still custom in a sense. The only true standard header is `Authorization: Bearer` introduced by the OAuth2 framework.
